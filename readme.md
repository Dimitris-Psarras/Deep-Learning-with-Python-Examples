# Deep Learning with Python Examples
This repository contains examples implementing the code samples found in the book "Deep Learning with Python", written by Francois Chollet. 

## Desclaimer
The examples presented here are already published by the author in his [Github account](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks). Those found in this repository are made by myself for my own learning, with no intention to steal intellectual property.
